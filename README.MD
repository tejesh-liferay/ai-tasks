# AI Tasks

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#peerkar/ai-tasks:gitter.im)

## TL;DR 
AI Tasks is an LLM integrated, low-code workflow orchestration tool for  Liferay. It can be used standalone, for example for Liferay chatbots and chat interfaces but also integrated to Liferay workflows and to external worfklow orchestrators and vice versa. It lets to visually define AI workflows which are then exposed through a REST endpoint. Liferay integration enables governing access, permissions and auditing with the standard Liferay tools as well as easy integration to existing or new Liferay features, to leverage AI.

AI Tasks backend is built on [LangChain4J](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/) and supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for creating standard creating integrations to external and internal services.

## Features

* **AI integration**: Integrate with Anthropic, Vertex AI, OpenAI, Ollama or HuggingFace chat and image LLMs.
* **MCP support**: Integrate the tasks to [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers 
* **Workflow orchestration**: Design workflows with a visual editor. Export & import  as JSON configuration files.
* **Liferay integration**: Manage access, permissions and policies with Liferay. Trigger and consume the tasks through REST API.
* **Data locality**: Local LLMs supported through Ollama. 
* **3rd Party Integration**: Integrate to 3rd party workflow automation tools. Let 3rd party tools to integrate  to it via REST APIs.
* **Open Source**: Extend and customize the task node types and function callback to your needs

### Example Use Cases
* Create **chatbots** on Liferay
* Integrate chatbots to external or internal services with the help of [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
* Add AI **translation** capabilities to Liferay pages, display templates or applications
* Add AI **summarization** capabilities to Liferay pages, display templates or applications
* Add **image & content generation** capabilities to Liferay pages, display templates or applications
* Create **RAG chatbots** grounded to local Liferay semantic search or for example to Google Search
* **Integrate Liferay OOTB workflows with AI**

### How To Use It? (The TL;DR Version)

1. Create an AI Task, for example a simple LLM chat using the visual designer
1. From the provided test chatbot, a Liferay display template, client extension, your own frontend or from anywhere, consume the AI Task through its `generate` REST endpoint:


For example, to send the text `Please tell me a joke` for an AI Tasks with external reference code `sampleJokingChatbotUsingVertexAI`, one would send a payload like this:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/o/ai-tasks/v1.0/generate/sampleJokingChatbotUsingVertexAI' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-csrf-token: kPNn0CrS' \
  -d '{
  "input": {
"text": "Please tell me a joke"}
}'
```

If everything was set up correctly, the response, with debug on, should look something like this:

```
{
  "debugInfo": {
    "1": {
      "userMessage": "Please tell me a joke",
      "executionTime": "1921ms",
      "inputTokenCount": 21,
      "systemMessage": "You are a polite assistant and try to help people as good as you can.",
      "finishReason": "STOP",
      "totalTokenCount": 72,
      "outputTokenCount": 51
    }
  },
  "output": {
    "text": "Why did the golfer wear two pants? Because he's afraid he might get a \"Hole-in-one.\" \n\nThis is a classic punny joke!  Let me know if you'd like to hear another one. 😊"
  },
  "took": "1921ms"
}
```

## Examples
Sample AI Tasks are provided in the [samples](./samples) folder.


## Installation

### Requirements

* Liferay DXP 7.4
* Java 17
* The desired AI services / accounts set up

### 1. Install the Modules

1. Clone the repository:
```
git@github.com:peerkar/ai-tasks.git
```
2. Set up the Liferay bundle. If using the workspace bundle, go to the `liferay-workspace` folder and run:
```
gw initBundle
```
3. Start up the DXP and deploy the license
4. In both the `modules` and `client-extensions` directory run:
```
gw deploy
```
5. Verify from Liferay logs that all the modules were deployed and started succesfully
6. Access the _AI Tasks Admin_ app in the _Applications_ menu 

### 2. Set up the LLMs

Set up your preferred APIs and services as needed:

* [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
* [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index)
* [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
* [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment). In local development environment, the gcloud CLI is required.

### 3. Access the Admin Application

Log in to the portal and go to the Application -> AI Tasks -> AI Tasks Admin

### 4. Test 

Import a  [sample](./samples) or create your own task and either test it:

* In the AI Task Admin preview
* On the [local API test page](http://localhost:8080/o/api?endpoint=http://localhost:8080/o/ai-tasks/v1.0/openapi.json)
* In the provided test chatbot client extension

## Configuration

See the [configuration reference](CONFIGURATION.MD).

## Extending AI TAsks

Currently there are 3 extension points:
* Nodes
* Tools
* Chat model listeners

See the [SPI module](https://github.com/peerkar/ai-tasks/tree/main/liferay-workspace/modules/ai-tasks-spi/src/main/java/fi/soveltia/liferay/aitasks/spi/task).

For extending the tooling, using  [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is recommended.

## Good to Remember

### Set Up the LLM Quotas
Always use quotas when integrating to external LLM service providers.

## Known Issues

### Performance
LLM calls can take a long time to execute, meaning blocked threads. This issue will be mitigated with https://github.com/peerkar/ai-tasks/issues/2


### Multimodality
AI Tasks is using the LangChain4J AI Services, which don't currently support multimodal input. Please see https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/issues/938

### GCloud Client Authentication & Timeouts

Authentication to Vertex AI doesn't work if the gcloud authentication is not done before starting the DXP. To authenticate, enter on the command line:
```
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth login
```
If the authorization key is timed out. The portal needs to be shut down before reauthenticating.
